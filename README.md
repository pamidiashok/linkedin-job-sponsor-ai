An intelligent LinkedIn job search and analysis tool built with Python, Streamlit, and GPT (via LangChain), designed to help users filter job listings based on visa sponsorship availability. The app provides a simple UI to search jobs and uses AI to read job descriptions and detect whether the job offers sponsorship — going far beyond basic keyword matching.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Searches LinkedIn for job listings based on filters like title, location, posting date, remote options, salary, etc.
- Retrieves full job descriptions using LinkedIn’s guest-access job API.
- Uses an AI agent (powered by OpenAI GPT via LangChain) to analyze the **full job description**, and intelligently decide whether visa sponsorship is available.
- Visually shows job-by-job sponsorship responses in real-time with colored feedback (`YES` = green, `NO` = red).
- Offers both **CLI** and **Streamlit web UI** options to use the tool.

---

## 🧠 How the AI Agent Works

This project integrates **LangChain** and **OpenAI GPT** (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) to build a modular and intelligent reasoning pipeline:

- Full job descriptions are passed through a **LangChain PromptTemplate** that asks the model to infer visa sponsorship availability.
- The AI agent doesn't just look for keywords — it understands nuance. For example:
  - `"Visa sponsorship is not available"` → ❌ `no`
  - `"Sponsorship may be available"` or `"We offer sponsorship"` → ✅ `yes`
- This logic is built in a reusable agent function that can be extended to include more capabilities (e.g., job classification or summarization).

---

## 💡 Why LangChain?

We use [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to:

- Create structured agent flows (state management, prompt templates).
- Modularize LLM interactions for clarity and extensibility.
- Provide cleaner integration with OpenAI’s GPT models via `langchain-openai`.

LangChain lets us build a more explainable and maintainable AI logic pipeline — rather than using raw prompts directly.

## 🧠 How LangChain Is Used

This project uses **LangChain** to create a structured, intelligent, and maintainable AI reasoning pipeline.

### 🔹 What LangChain brings to the table:

- **Prompt templating:** We use `PromptTemplate` to define a consistent, reusable question to the language model asking it to determine visa sponsorship availability.
- **State handling:** LangChain’s structure helps us build typed and clean data flows (`TypedDict` state).
- **Model invocation:** We use LangChain’s `ChatOpenAI` interface to cleanly communicate with GPT (gpt-4 or gpt-3.5), while keeping the code modular and production-ready.
- **Extensibility:** With LangChain, it’s easy to later add more "nodes" like:
  - Classify jobs by industry
  - Extract named entities (company, technologies)
  - Summarize job descriptions

### 📦 Code Example:

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["description"],
    template=(
        "Carefully read the following job description. Only respond 'yes' if the company explicitly states "
        "they offer visa sponsorship. If not mentioned or denied, respond 'no'.\n\n"
        "Job Description:\n{description}\n\nVisa Sponsorship available? (yes or no):"
    )
)

message = HumanMessage(content=prompt.format(description=state["description"]))
sponsorship = llm.invoke([message]).content.strip().lower()
```
